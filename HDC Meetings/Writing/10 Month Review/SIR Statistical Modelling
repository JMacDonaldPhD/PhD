Paired Infection and Removal times representation (Individual level)


POISSON PROCESS (brief):

Definition of a poisson process:

1. Stationary point process, meaning the number of events which occur in two disjoint time periods are equal in distribution. 

2. Independent increments

3. The number of events n which occur in an interval [t, t+s) follows a Poisson distribution. 

SPECIFICS CAN BE FOUND IN (TEXT BOOKS)

The time in between events occuring is Exponential with rate lambda


We can model an Epidemic using a Poisson Process,

The total rate of events will be the sum of total infection rate X(t)*Y(t)*beta and the total removal rate Y(t)*gamma

lambda(t) = X(t)*Y(t)*beta + Y(t)*gamma

This creates an inhomogeneous Poisson process with respect to time as the rate of events varies over time as the population dynamics change.

Events change the value of lambda(t), therefore increments are no longer independent.
