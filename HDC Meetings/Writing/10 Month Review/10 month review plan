INTRODUCTION:

        ==============
	Aim of the PhD...

	Create a Statistical Method to make inference (Offline and Online) on Epidemic Panel Data.
        
        Most Accurate while staying efficient (i.e overnight inference)

        ==============

	What this invovles/What are the key steps...

        Motivation i.e what situation do we use panel data (DRUM Project)
 
        Representing Epidemics with Mathematics/Statisics

        Representing Panel Data
	
        Candidate methods for inference MCMC/ABC
        
        Peformance of methods in different epidemic situations (Accuracy, Efficiency, Timescale)


        ===============

	GENERAL:
	=======

        What is an Infectious Disease Epidemiology/Epidemics/Endemics etc.?
        
        The study of the spread of infectious diseases.

        Usually disease is assumed to be transimitted through contact of an infected individual with a
        susceptible individual.

        Can also be vector-bourne. 
	=======

	How are Epidemics modelled?

	Represent the dynamics of the disease through states and the transition rates between these states.

	Quick example of SIR.

        This can be done at population and individual level.

	=======

	What are the challenges in collecting Infectious Disease data?

	Best models make use of exact times of events (i.e the times at which individuals move from one state to another)
	
	It is also easiest to write down a likelihood in this case.

	Howevever, more often than not it is not possible to do this.

	Some state transitions are impossible to record exactly i.e infection times

	May be limited in resources i.e money/time. This leads to asking the following questions.

	How often can we sample the population?

	How much of the population can we sample? 

	Breifly, how can we go about analysing this data and what are the limitations?

	Due to these limitations, there will be gaps in the data collected (Missing data). Then the question is, how do we deal with the missing data.

        OPTIONS: 

	Make a best guess at the parameters and ignoring the missing data

	Make a best guess at what the missing values are and estimate the parameters of the model using a combination of real data and imputated data.

		
        ==============
        SPECIFIC:

	What is anti-microbial resistance (AMR), how does it spread and how is it cured or prevented from spreading?

	AMR is the general resistance of microbials to a drug or treatment which they would not normally resist.

	Uganda, AMR possibly passed round due to poor hygiene.
	
	What are the challenges in collecting the data needed to make inference on this infectious process?

	Money, time.
        
        =============

MODELLING/ANALYSING INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN STATISTICS:

	OBSERVING EPIDEMIC IN CONTINUOUS TIME (HOMOGENEOUS):

	Assuming closed population, finished epidemic.

	Poisson Process, exponential waiting times between events.

        Then there are a number of differents events which can happen depending on the Epidemic model structure. 

	Likelihood is usually tractable and can use Gibbs sampler.

	Likelihood does depend on paired vs non-paired infection/removal times

	Observation Process (Missing Infection Times)

        

	Markov Process (Poisson Process)
	
	Paired Infection Times

	ABC, MCMC (Centered, Non-centered, Partially Non-centered).

	Limitations.

	OBSERVING EPIDEMICS IN DISCRETE TIME (HOMOGENEOUS):

	Observation Process (Panel Data)

	Hypergeometric Distribution of Panel Data (Assuming Independence)

	Pseudo-Marginal MCMC

	Forward Simulation EBC/MCMC

	Extending to Endemics, Heterogenous populations (Household Model)
