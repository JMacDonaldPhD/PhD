INTRODUCTION:

	Aim of the PhD

	What this involes/What are the key steps
	
	What is an Infectious Disease Epidemiology/Epidemics/Endemics etc.?

	GENERAL:

	What are the challenges in collecting Infectious Disease data?

	Breifly, how can we go about analysing this data and what are the limitations?

	SPECIFIC:

	What is anti-microbial resistance, how does it spread and how is it cured or prevented from spreading?

	What are the challenges in collecting the data needed to make inference on this infectious process?

MODELLING/ANALYSING INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN STATISTICS:

	OBSERVING EPIDEMIC IN CONTINUOUS TIME (HOMOGENEOUS):

	Observation Process (Missing Infection Times)

	Markov Process (Poisson Process)
	
	Paired Infection Times

	ABC, MCMC (Centered, Non-centered, Partially Non-centered).

	Limitations.

	OBSERVING EPIDEMICS IN DISCRETE TIME (HOMOGENEOUS):

	Observation Process (Panel Data)

	Hypergeometric Distribution of Panel Data (Assuming Independence)

	Pseudo-Marginal MCMC

	Forward Simulation EBC/MCMC

	Extending to Endemics, Heterogenous populations (Household Model)
